# My Papers for SS14

**This repo hosts papers personally given to or made by me, also known as Heir-Topith (Talon) or Kiriki.**

NOTE:
The `# text label` seen at the top of every file is a Document Label, it will automatically label the document when the document is printed via a fax machine.
PLEASE remove the label and the line its on if you are not printing the document ingame but rather pasting it ingame.
